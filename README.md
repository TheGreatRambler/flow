## Upgrading Version

* Check [FTC's commit diff](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/commits/master) if anything related to Gradle changed. If it did, change those files accordingly
* Download ZIP of the new version -- do not attempt to merge
* With a file manager, drag in `/libs`, `/doc`, `/FtcRobotController` and replace all
* Done. **Never touch TeamCode, and highly advised not to touch any gradle stuff unless it'll break otherwise**
